# litsdf — Claude Code Instructions

## Workspace Structure

litsdf is a Cargo workspace with four crates:

- **`litsdf_core`** — Data model, SDF math, scene computation, persistence. **No Bevy dependency.** Uses glam 0.30 directly (same version Bevy uses, so types are compatible).
- **`litsdf_render`** — Bevy rendering plugin. Material, camera, gizmos, picking, scene sync. Depends on core + Bevy.
- **`litsdf_editor`** — Editor UI plugin. litui panels, undo, testing, node editor. Depends on core + render + litui + egui-snarl.
- **`litsdf_cli`** — Command-line tool for manipulating scene YAML files. Depends on core + clap. **No Bevy/GPU dependency.**

Three binaries: `litsdf` (editor), `litsdf-viewer` (3D viewport only), `litsdf-cli` (CLI scene manipulation).

## API Reference

After any code change, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/generate-api-docs.py
```

The generated `knowledge/api/API.md` covers all four crates with full type definitions, function signatures, and cross-crate dependency stratification.

## Running

```sh
cargo run --bin litsdf                       # editor
cargo run --bin litsdf-viewer -- scene.yaml  # viewer
cargo run -p litsdf-cli -- scene info s.yaml # CLI
cargo test --workspace                       # 68 tests
LITSDF_SCREENSHOT=path.png cargo run --bin litsdf  # screenshot
```

## Critical Rules

- Material bindings use `@group(3)` in WGSL, NOT `@group(2)`
- Editor UI systems run in `EguiPrimaryContextPass`, NOT `Update` (including undo/redo — handled inline via egui shortcuts)
- Use `#[uniform(0)]` with inline data for SdfMaterial, NOT storage buffers
- Skip property sync on the frame selection changes
- When drag handles are active, suppress orbit camera and property sync
- All model fields need `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if)]` for compact YAML
- `litsdf_core` must NOT depend on Bevy — use `glam` directly
- `glam` version must match Bevy's internal glam (0.30) to avoid type mismatches
- `ShaderShape` in Rust (`shader.rs`) and WGSL (`sdf_raymarch.wgsl`) must be byte-identical — add/remove fields in BOTH or rendering breaks silently
- `SdfShaderParams` settings fields MUST go AFTER the shapes array, not before — inserting before shapes shifts the array offset and Metal silently fails to render (no error, just blank viewport)
- `assets/shaders/` is a RUNTIME directory (gitignored, generated). The SOURCE shader lives at `crates/litsdf_render/assets/shaders/sdf_raymarch.wgsl`. Codegen writes to `assets/shaders/sdf_raymarch.wgsl`. Always edit the CRATE copy.
- Animation is done via node graphs (egui-snarl), NOT via model fields — `anim_*` fields were removed; old YAML files with `anim_*` will fail to load with a migration message
- `litsdf_core` must NOT depend on egui-snarl — node graphs live in `litsdf_editor` as `HashMap<ShapeId/BoneId, Snarl<SdfNode>>`
- `compute_bone_world_transforms` takes `&HashMap<BoneId, ShapeTransform>` for overrides, not `time: f32` — pass empty HashMap when no overrides needed
- WGSL `vec3(scalar)` shorthand is NOT supported by Bevy's naga — always use `vec3<f32>(x, x, x)` with explicit components
- Shader codegen writes to `assets/shaders/sdf_raymarch.wgsl` (runtime copy, gitignored) on topology change — Bevy hot-reloads automatically. Source shader + preamble/postamble live in `crates/litsdf_render/assets/shaders/` (committed). On startup, `ensure_runtime_shader()` copies the fallback loop-based shader to the runtime location.
- Lighting uses Cook-Torrance PBR (GGX + Fresnel-Schlick + Smith geometry), NOT Blinn-Phong
